Documentation for the `portlet.py` module

= Introduction =

The `portlet.py` module wraps the JSR-168 API to make is super simple to program portlets using Python syntax.

= Examples =
The `portlet.Portlet` class delegates calls to `render` and `processAction` to `view` and `action`, respectively. The request / response objects are then wrapped in python objects that implement many of the __ methods for nicer syntax.

== Hello World ==
This portlet demonstrates how to send output to the response using the `<<` operator for C++ style output.
{{{
from portlet import Portlet

class HelloPortlet (Portlet):
    def view(self, request, response):
        response << '<h2>Hello Jython</h2>'
}}}

== Accessing parameters ==
This portlet demonstrates how to check if a parameter is in the request and how to access it. It also shows how to use the `response.view(**params)` method to create portlet render URLs. To create an action URL, use `response.action(**params)`.
{{{
class NamePortlet (Portlet):
    def view(self, request, response):
        if 'name' in request:
            response << '<p>Hello ' << request['name'] << '</p>'
	    response << '<a href="' << response.view() << '">Bye!</a>'
}}}
